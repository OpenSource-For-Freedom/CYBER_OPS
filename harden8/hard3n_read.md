# Why Develop This Tool for Debian Linux and Website Security?

## 1. Debian as a Popular Server OS
- Debian is widely used for hosting websites due to its stability and large repository of software. However, its default configurations focus more on usability than security. This makes hardening essential for any public-facing server to prevent attacks.

## 2. Need for Automated Security
- Manual security configurations are error-prone and time-intensive. Automating security tasks ensures consistency, reduces human errors, and streamlines the process for administrators or less-experienced users.
- This script incorporates modern tools (e.g., **Podman**, **Firejail**, **UFW**, **Fail2Ban**) to secure the system while automating containerization, monitoring, and sandboxing.

## 3. Evolving Threat Landscape
- Hosting websites exposes servers to potential threats like brute force, SQL injection, malware infections, and privilege escalation.
- This script preemptively addresses these risks with:
  - **Firewall rules (UFW)**.
  - **Malware scanning (ClamAV)**.
  - **Intrusion detection (Fail2Ban)**.
  - **System auditing (Lynis)**.

## 4. Containerization and Sandboxing
- **Podman**, **Firejail**, and **Bubblewrap** are excellent for isolating applications like web browsers and web services. These tools ensure that compromised software cannot affect the entire system.
- Containerizing search engines, web browsers, or custom applications adds another layer of security, especially when accessing untrusted content.

## 5. Improving Usability for Administrators
- By integrating tools like **LXD/LXC** and automating their setup, this script makes advanced security features accessible to users without requiring deep expertise in Linux or system security.

## 6. Focus on Open-Source Collaboration
- Keeping the script open source fosters community involvement, allowing others to audit, improve, or adapt it to their use cases. This aligns with the open-source philosophy of transparency and shared knowledge.

# Key Features of the Script

## 1. Security Baseline Setup
- Enables **AppArmor**, a mandatory access control system to restrict processes.
- Sets up a firewall (**UFW**) with default deny-all rules for inbound traffic, ensuring only explicitly allowed ports (like SSH) are accessible.

## 2. Containerization and Sandboxing
- Configures **Podman**, **LXC/LXD**, **Firejail**, and **Bubblewrap** to isolate applications.
- Provides examples for sandboxing Firefox, making it adaptable for securing other applications.

## 3. Real-Time Monitoring and Auditing
- Integrates **Fail2Ban** to monitor and block suspicious login attempts.
- Uses **Lynis** for comprehensive system auditing and reports.

## 4. Malware Scanning
- Sets up **ClamAV** for periodic scans and logs any threats found.

## 5. Ease of Use
- The script ensures that all actions are logged, errors are caught early, and the administrator is prompted for key decisions (e.g., enabling SSH).

# Why Itâ€™s Relevant for Websites

Hosting a website introduces specific challenges:
- Protecting sensitive user data.
- Ensuring uptime by mitigating DDoS attacks or other disruptions.
- Complying with privacy laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR).

This script is particularly useful for securing a server before deploying a website, as it:
- Closes unused ports, reducing the attack surface.
- Provides tools for real-time monitoring.
- Implements best practices for application isolation.
