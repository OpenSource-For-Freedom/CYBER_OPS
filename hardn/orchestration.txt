Src/ Directory:

hardn.py: The main orchestration script that provides the GUI and coordinates the execution of various tasks.

packages.py: Contains functions to install and configure security packages. Ensures all necessary tools are present and correctly set up.

HARDN_dark.py: Implements system lockdown procedures and manages Docker container deployment. Enhances system security and isolates applications within containers.

utils.py: Provides utility functions shared across different modules, such as executing commands and running audits.

Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image that encapsulates the entire application. Manages updates, monitoring, and system management through malware scanners.

Workflow Summary

Initialization:

hardn.py ensures the script runs with root privileges.

The GUI is initialized to provide real-time status updates.

Dependency and Package Management:

packages.py checks and installs required security tools.

Functions like configure_apparmor and configure_firejail are called to set up specific security measures.

System Lockdown and Container Deployment:

HARDN_dark.py performs system lockdown by configuring UFW and setting up Docker.

Deploys containers to encapsulate applications securely.

Monitoring and Updates:

The Docker image manages package updates and system monitoring using tools like LMD and cron jobs.

Future plans include integrating Legion.c for enhanced malware scanning.

Execution:

The entire process runs headless, providing a secure and isolated environment for the application.







# Project Overview

## HARDN (Orchestration)
- **Purpose:** Manages the overall orchestration of the system, ensuring everything is up-to-date and patched.
- **File:** `hardn.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Acts as the main entry point.
  - Provides a GUI to manage and display the process.
  - Calls functions from `packages.py` and `HARDN_dark.py` based on user input.
  - Orchestrates the execution of various security-related tasks.

## Package Management
- **Purpose:** Loads and configures security tools.
- **File:** `packages.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Contains functions to install and configure various security packages (e.g., AppArmor, Firejail).
  - Ensures all required security tools are installed and properly configured.

## Lockdown and Containerization
- **Purpose:** Handles system lockdown and deploys Docker images locally.
- **File:** `HARDN_dark.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Contains functions to enhance system security (e.g., configuring UFW, setting up Docker).
  - Deploys containers to manage applications and services securely.
  - Ensures the system is locked down and runs securely within containers.

## Docker Image
- **Purpose:** Containerizes the app as a whole and manages package updates, monitoring, and system management through malware scanners.
- **File:** `Dockerfile`
- **Functionality:**
  - Defines the Docker image that encapsulates the entire application.
  - Manages package updates and system monitoring using tools like LMD (Linux Malware Detect) and cron jobs.
  - Plans to integrate Legion.c for enhanced malware scanning in the future.
  - Runs headless, providing a secure and isolated environment for the application.
